Many questions in real life do not have a clear answer but are subject to controversy, e.g., who is right in some political discussion or what is the best product for a particular purpose. Controversy is the central concept that fosters argumentation. Argumentation includes to exchange ideas and opinions, to defend positions, and to convince others of certain stances.Nowadays, in a vast number of situations, a search for relevant arguments is performed on the web, which is considered the richest and most up-to-date source of information, and which is a dynamic environment for controversial topics. While today’s search engines achieve to rank links to the most relevant web pages highest for a large proportion of search queries, a web search for arguments is not explicitly envisaged.
