COVID-19 has caused enormous pressure upon policy-makers to make critical strategy decisions under hard time constraints. In times of crisis, policy-makers may use different strategies to attempt to constrain the crisis. The effect of these strategies can hardly be anticipated. Beforehand it is unclear which strategies are more effective to convince the citizens of implementing protective measures for reducing the infection rate.

This project studies the evolution of public opinions in light of the events (e.g., new government measures, a high lethality rate etc.) related to COVID-19 and the respective strategies adopted by different countries and regions. We aim to answer the following question: How do citizens respond to the strategies adopted by policy-makers in different geographical areas? We rely on a large volume of unstructured data from COVID-19 Twitter posts in multiple languages, as well as on news articles, official press releases and public addresses from policy-makers.
